# Pet-store-app
This short program is like an app for a pet adoption centre. It allows users and workers to create and log into their accounts and each of them is able to do multiple actions.

## Worker
The worker will be able to:
- add a new pet
- remove an existing pet
- update an existing pet

## User
The user will be able to:
- adopt a pet
- search for a pet depending on its breed and age
- the user can give up an animal that he initially wanted to adopt

##
**The made modifications will affect both the accounts currently in use and the ones that are not currently in use.** 
The app uses the QT graphical interface.
